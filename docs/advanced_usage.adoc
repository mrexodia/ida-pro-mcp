= Advanced Usage
:toc:

These notes cover more advanced scenarios when working with the MCP server.

== Headless operation

If you have `idalib` installed you can run the server on an IDB in headless
mode:

[source,shell]
----
uv run idalib-mcp --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8745 path/to/executable
----

This provides the same JSONâ€‘RPC tools without launching the full IDA GUI.

== Development workflow

New tools can be added simply by decorating a function in `mcp-plugin.py` with
`@jsonrpc`.  Start the development server to experiment with the API:

[source,shell]
----
uv run mcp dev src/ida_pro_mcp/server.py
----

A small web interface opens on http://localhost:5173 allowing you to try out the
available methods.
