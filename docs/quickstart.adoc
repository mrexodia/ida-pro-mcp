This guide shows how to get the IDA Pro MCP server running quickly.

== Installation

Install the package directly from GitHub:

[source,shell]
----
pip uninstall ida-pro-mcp
pip install git+https://github.com/mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp
----

Then install the IDA plugin and configure the local server:

[source,shell]
----
ida-pro-mcp --install
----

Restart IDA Pro and your MCP client to load the plugin.

== Basic usage

Once installed, open a database in IDA and start the server through
`Edit -> Plugins -> MCP` or by pressing the keyboard shortcut shown by the
plugin.  Use your favourite MCP client to call the provided tools such as
`check_connection` or `decompile_function`.
