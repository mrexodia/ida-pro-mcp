This guide shows how to get the IDA Pro MCP server running quickly.

== Installation

Clone the repository and run the bootstrap script.  Pass the path to your local
model as the first argument:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp
cd ida-pro-mcp
scripts/bootstrap.sh /path/to/model.gguf
----

The script installs all requirements and stores the model path in
`~/Library/Application Support/ida-offline-mcp/settings.json`.

Run `scripts/install_ida_plugin.sh` to place the plugin under
`~/.idapro/plugins/` and restart IDA to load it.

== Basic usage

Once installed, open a database in IDA and launch the MCP plugin through
`Edit -> Plugins -> MCP`.  A chat dock appears allowing you to interact with the
MCP tools.  Run `check_connection()` in the dock to verify the connection before
using other tools like `decompile_function`.
