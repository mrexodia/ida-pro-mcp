This guide shows how to get the IDA Pro MCP server running quickly.

== Installation

Clone the repository and run the bootstrap script.  Pass the path to your local
model as the first argument:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp
cd ida-pro-mcp
scripts/bootstrap.sh /path/to/model.gguf
----

The script installs all requirements and stores the model path in
`~/Library/Application Support/ida-offline-mcp/settings.json`.

Copy `src/ida_pro_mcp/mcp-plugin.py` to the IDA plugins directory and restart
IDA to load the plugin.

== Basic usage

Once installed, open a database in IDA and launch the MCP plugin through
`Edit -> Plugins -> MCP`.  A chat dock appears allowing you to interact with the
MCP tools such as `check_connection` or `decompile_function`.
