= Configuration
:toc:

This document covers how to configure different clients and install the plugin
manually.

== Automatic configuration

Running `ida-pro-mcp --config` prints a JSON snippet that can be pasted into
supported clients such as Cline, Roo Code or Cursor.  It points the client to
the local MCP server started with the `--install` command.

== Manual installation

The plugin can also be set up manually.  Clone this repository and configure
your client with a command similar to:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github.com/mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/path/to/ida-pro-mcp", "run", "server.py", "--install-plugin"],
      "timeout": 1800,
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
----

After the server starts the plugin is copied to the IDA plugins directory and
can be launched from the *Edit â†’ Plugins* menu.
