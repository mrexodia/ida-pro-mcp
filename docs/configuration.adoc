This document explains where to place your model and which environment
variables affect the plugin.

== Model location

`scripts/bootstrap.sh` writes the chosen model path to
`~/Library/Application Support/ida-offline-mcp/settings.json`.  Edit this
file to change the model later.

== Environment variables

`ALLOW_NET=1`:: allow outbound network connections from IDAPython.  The
plugin blocks non-local traffic by default.
